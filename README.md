# Libft

WELCOME to your libft! Your new life starts here. Meet your new baby sister MEMORY LEAKS, your 17 year old "juvenile" delinquent big BIG brother SEG FAULTS, and the two twin infant hyenas that were dumped on our porch harder than as a something something, not hard enough, norminette and moulinette.

So, you've decided you're sick of manuals and tutorials, your chatgpt output continues to deliver the most insane, un-googlable errors in the universe, and that your brain is depressingly not the greatest amazing piece of pink splap that's ever graced newton's great green earth, very much unlike those errors you keep having spat at you.

Well stay and copy and paste a while paht-ner. At least so you can test whether the Macs have finally blah flah balh, or it is, in fact, your code. Perhaps it's been us all along.

Get in touch if you'd like an explanation of any of this ch. Or don't. I get paid either way. x.
