# Libft

WELCOME to the libft! Your life starts here. Meet your baby sister MEMORY LEAKS, your 17 year old, "juvenile", delinquent uncle MAKEFILE, and the two twin infant hyenas, dumped on your porch harder than a catholic priests something something..., NORMINETTE and MOULINETTE!

So, your code sucks. You've travelled half way around the earth to where the competition's weak and your farts smell like roasted peanuts being whaffed over a windy winters morn. You IMMASCULATE the others as you explain AT them the difference between int and unsigned char as if you've been smashing leetcode problems in c++ since you were a toddler. But now as you sit down at your sinking swivel chair, next to your NOW closest friend in the world, Nick, whom you've talked to on discord, maybe, twice since you saw him/her last, once to ask them if she/he got into the school, cos you, of course, did, and once more by accident while you were stalking your piscine crush, mumbling under your breath and shaking your head, muttering to yourself 'i fk wrote strlcat a million times why tf is it not working fking francinette ffffsake ffk why???... You've decided you're sick of manuals and tutorials, chatgpt continues to deliver the most insane, un-googlable errors the world has ever seen, and that your brain is (depressingly, but DURR!) NOT the greatest amazing piece of pink splap that's ever splatted in through these doors, as gcc pours line after line of 'did you mean's and 'expected expression's before seg faulting.

Sound even a LITTLE BIT familiar? Well stay and copy and paste a while paht-ner. It's gonna be a long, bumpy ride... yeeeeeehaaaa!
